[Why are people shopping less with Bitcoin and shifting to altcoins](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/01/17/buying-with-cryptos-here-s-why-you-may-favour-altcoins-such-as-ether-and-doge-over-bitcoin)

I find this article pretty interesting and feel like it could be related to the price of Bitcoin going up. It could be related to how our brain perceives the value of a token. Seeing yourself hold 1 BTC in contrast to 200,000 DOGE you would think that the higher the number of tokens that you are holding the more valuable it is. Not only that but the more tokens you hold the more you are inclined to think that the value of that token will exponentially increase sometimes not taking into account the market cap of the token. With that being said I think that as one look at their wallet and sees a large amount of tokens in it, they feel more confident in their ability to make a purchase.

I also found this article interesting in that even though Bitcoin is one of the most valuable and popular cryptocurrencies that exist, using Bitcoin as a form of payment dropped to 65 per cent in 2021 from 92 per cent in 2020. Maybe a reason for this is that since bitcoin is much more expensive that altcoins such as Ethereum, stablecoins, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Litecoin, less people are able to purchase it that altcoins. So since more people are able to purchase Ethereum over bitcoin, it will be used more often. Another reason could be because investors view Bitcoin as more of a long-term investment compared to the altcoins.
